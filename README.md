#INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide, responsible for a significant percentage of cancer-related deaths each year. Its high mortality rate is largely attributed to delayed diagnosis, which limits the effectiveness of treatment options. Early-stage lung cancer often presents subtle abnormalities that are challenging to detect, even with advanced imaging techniques such as CT scans and X-rays. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on manual interpretation by radiologists, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. These challenges highlight the need for automated solutions that can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer diagnosis. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have revolutionized the field of medical imaging. Among these, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has emerged as a powerful architecture capable of capturing both global and local features within complex medical images. Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs leverage multi-head self-attention mechanisms, making them particularly effective for analyzing nuanced patterns in lung scans. This project employs a ViT-based approach to classify lung conditions into three categories: normal, benign, and malignant To address common challenges such as class imbalance and overfitting, the system incorporates techniques like weighted loss functions, extensive data augmentation, and a robust preprocessing pipeline. Additionally, explainability tools such as Grad-CAM provide visual insights into the model’s predictions, fostering trust and usability among clinicians. Designed for real-world deployment, this solution aims to enhance early detection rates, streamline diagnostic workflows, and improve patient outcomes across diverse healthcare environments.

## PROBLEM DEFINITION
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with survival rates significantly hindered by late-stage diagnoses. Early detection can improve outcomes, yet it faces multiple challenges. Traditional diagnostic meth ods, such as manual interpretation of CT scans and X-rays, are time-intensive and prone to human error. Radiologists often struggle with subtle visual features and overlapping patterns between benign and malignant tumors, leading to false positives or negatives. Additionally, the lack of standardization across diagnostic systems contributes to inconsistent results and delays in treatment. Another critical issue is the imbalance in medical imaging datasets, where malignant cases are underrepresented com pared to benign and normal instances. This imbalance biases machine learning models, reducing their sensitivity to malig nant cases, which are vital for early detection. The complexity of lung image patterns further complicates analysis. Address ing these challenges requires a robust, automated solution capable of enhancing accuracy, reducing errors, and supporting early diagnosis in diverse settings.

## EXISTING SYSTEM
The current methods for lung cancer detection predom inantly rely on traditional diagnostic approaches, such as manual interpretation of chest X-rays and CT scans, often performed by radiologists. These techniques, while widely used, have several limitations. Radiologists may misinterpret subtle abnormalities due to factors such as fatigue, varying levels of expertise, or the overlapping characteristics of benign and malignant tumors. These challenges result in high rates of false positives and false negatives, delaying accurate diagnoses and treatment. Existing automated solutions in lung cancer detection are primarily based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have shown promise in medical image analysis. How ever, CNNs often struggle to capture complex global features and subtle patterns within medical images, particularly in cases of early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, they are heavily influenced by the class imbalance inherent in medical datasets, leading to biased predictions that prioritize majority classes like benign or normal cases. Additionally, many existing systems lack interpretability, making it difficult for clinicians to trust and validate their predictions. Explainability is crucial in medical diagnostics to ensure that AI systems can provide insights into their decision-making process. Furthermore, current tools are often resource-intensive and poorly suited for deployment in low resource settings, limiting their accessibility and real-world applicability. These shortcomings highlight the need for advanced solu tions that address these gaps, offering higher accuracy, better handling of imbalanced datasets, enhanced interpretability, and scalability for diverse clinical environments.

## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
This project aims to develop an AI-powered diagnostic system for lung cancer detection, leveraging the Vision Trans former (ViT) architecture to address limitations in traditional methods. The system focuses on classifying lung scans into three categories: normal, benign, and malignant, with ViT’s ability to capture both local and global features ensuring accurate identification of subtle patterns like early-stage nod ules. To enhance the model’s robustness and generalization, comprehensive preprocessing techniques and data augmenta tion methods, including cropping, rotation, and flipping, are implemented. Class imbalance, a common issue in medical imaging datasets, is addressed using weighted loss functions, focal loss, and oversampling, ensuring reliable predictions across all categories, especially underrepresented malignant cases. Additionally, explainability tools like Grad-CAM are integrated to provide visual insights into the model’s predic tions, fostering trust among clinicians. The system is designed for real-world deployment, offering compatibility with existing hospital workflows and optimization for resource-constrained environments. By addressing critical challenges such as diag nostic inaccuracies, class imbalance, and lack of accessibility, the project seeks to improve early detection rates, streamline clinical workflows, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.
